# MIT_6001.x Problem Sets

This repository contains my solutions to the problem sets from the **MIT 6.00.1x - Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python** course. The course is offered by MIT on edX and covers fundamental programming concepts using Python and I did it as Part of my MIT Computer and DATA Science program.

## ðŸ“– Course Overview

MIT 6.00.1x introduces:

- Basic Python programming
- Control flow (loops, conditionals)
- Functions and recursion
- Object-oriented programming
- Computational complexity
- Algorithmic problem-solving

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the code:

1. Ensure you have **Python 3** installed.
2. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/MahdiaAhmadi/MIT_6001.x.git
   cd MIT_6001.x
   ```

## Run any problem set file using:

python3 filename.py
